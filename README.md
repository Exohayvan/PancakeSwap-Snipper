## About

This project aims to automate the process of sniping new tokens on PancakeSwap and includes basic checks to identify potential scam tokens. It utilizes the PancakeSwap router functions and performs code analysis to filter out suspicious tokens.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PancakeSwap Snipper, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Exohayvan/PancakeSwap-Snipper.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the program:
   - Set the `token_contract_address` and `pancake_swap_router_address` variables in the code to the desired contract addresses.
   - Customize the `scam_token_list` variable to include any known scam tokens you want to filter out.

4. Run the program:
   ```
   python snipper.py
   ```

## Usage

The program continuously checks for new token launches and executes sniping logic using PancakeSwap router functions. It performs basic code analysis and checks against a scam token blacklist to identify potential scams. Adjust the code analysis and scam token checks based on your requirements.

Please exercise caution and perform thorough research before engaging in token sniping or interacting with new tokens.
